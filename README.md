Dataset Descriptions to use 
•	CIC-IDS2017 was developed by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity and includes modern attack types such as brute force, DoS, DDoS, infiltration, web attacks, and botnets. Each record represents a network flow described by multiple features including duration, packet counts, byte rates, source and destination ports, and statistical attributes of traffic behavior.
•	UNSW-NB15, created by the Australian Centre for Cyber Security, contains realistic network activity generated using contemporary attack simulations. It includes nine attack categories and 49 features covering basic connection attributes, content features, and time-based traffic measures.
